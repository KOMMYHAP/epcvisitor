# ecpvisitor
# ecpvisitor, my first EPC test based on visitor pattern as a controller. The caveats is that visitor baseclass has so many methods, but you could still add more kinds of operations and visitorclass for different kinds of situations and than add some new attachVisitor for the new visitorbase class. With this constructions you could quickly and simple expand/scale up this structure, and letting things in the end (main.cpp) be very simplifyed. Remember this is one way to do it! there are several ways.
